   job-matching
   social-learning
   blockchain-certificates
   spring-boot
   nextjs
   flutter
   kubernetes
   microservices
   ```

### B. Branch Protection Rules
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Check:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators
5. Save changes

2. Actions permissions: "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
3. Workflow permissions: "Read and write permissions"

## Step 7: Add Required Secrets

Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, and add these secrets:

```
DOCKER_USERNAME          # Your Docker Hub username
DOCKER_PASSWORD          # Your Docker Hub password/token
OPENAI_API_KEY           # Your OpenAI API key
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL        # Slack webhook for notifications (optional)

```

## Step 8: Test the Setup

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test/initial-setup

# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> TEST.md
git add TEST.md
git commit -m "🧪 test: Add test file to verify CI/CD pipeline"

# Push test branch
git push -u origin test/initial-setup
```

1. Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request from `test/initial-setup` to `main`
2. Watch the CI/CD pipeline run
3. If all checks pass, merge the PR
4. Delete the test branch

## Step 9: Local Development Setup

```bash
# Make setup script executable (if on Unix/Mac)
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh scripts/deploy.sh

# Run development setup
./scripts/setup.sh

# Or manually start services:
# 1. Start databases
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# 2. Start backend (in new terminal)
cd career-os-backend
mvn spring-boot:run

# 3. Start frontend (in new terminal)
cd career-os-frontend
npm run dev
```
